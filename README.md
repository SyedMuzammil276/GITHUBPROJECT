# Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes to their code over time, enabling collaboration and easy reverting to previous versions. Essentially, it's a tool that helps manage different versions of files, particularly in software development, by recording all modifications and allowing developers to examine, revert to, or merge different versions.
